# How to construct visual patterns

Overview:
When using the mosquito arena, a visual pattern consists of a set of 2D images. When the arena displays each image depends on the settings you choose. If you run the arena in closed-loop, for example, the mosquito's left-minus-right wingbeat amplitude will determine which image is displayed. If you run the arena in open loop, you can specify a specific function to drive the display.
